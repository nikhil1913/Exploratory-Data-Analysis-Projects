# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Projects

Welcome to my **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** repository!
This repo is a collection of all my EDA-based projects where I explore real-world datasets, uncover patterns, visualize insights, and prepare data for predictive modeling.

## 🧠 About

EDA is a crucial step in any data science project — it helps us:

* Understand the data structure and its features
* Detect missing values and outliers
* Visualize relationships and trends
* Prepare data for machine learning models

Each project in this repository follows a systematic process of:

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
2. **Exploratory Analysis & Visualization**
3. **Insights & Key Findings**
